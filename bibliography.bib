abstract="People increasingly use mobile devices as their primary means to access the Internet. While it is well known that cellular network operators employ middleboxes, the details of their behavior and their impact on Web performance are poorly understood. This paper presents an analysis of proxy behavior and how transparent Web proxies interact with HTTP traffic in four major US cell carriers. We find that all four carriers use these proxies to interpose on HTTP traffic, but they vary in terms of whether they perform object caching, traffic redirection, image compression, and connection reuse. For example, some transparent proxies unilaterally lower the quality of images, which improves object fetch time but may hurt user satisfaction. We also find that these proxies do not necessarily enhance performance for mobile Web workloads in terms of object fetch times; namely, we observe noticeable benefits only when flow sizes are large and the path between the server and proxy exhibits large latency and/or loss.",

Each year, around 20 first-year undergraduate women who intend to major in computer science (CS) apply and are selected to participate. LLC participants live in a common residence hall and are provided with an educational, mentoring, and community-building program that supports their progress as students and CS majors. Participants take a "house course," Great Ideas and Insights in Computer Science, as a group, and also take a course on Knowledge and Power: Issues in Women's Leadership. Program activities include study sessions and industry interactions, as well as opportunities to participate in K-12 outreach programs, hackathons, and computing research. To evaluate the program, participants and a similar comparison group are surveyed at the beginning and end of the academic year and a focus group is conducted with program participants. Program participants find the program valuable and would recommend it to others, but both program participants and the comparison group report some lack of confidence in their potential success as computer scientists.},

As the Internet matures, policy questions loom larger in its
operation.  When should an ISP, city, or government invest in
infrastructure?  How do their policies affect use?  In this work, we
develop a new approach to evaluate how policies, economic conditions
and technology correlates with Internet use around the world.  First,
we develop an adaptive and accurate approach to
estimate \emph{block availability}, 
the fraction of active IP addresses in each /24 block
over short timescales (every 11 minutes).  Our estimator provides a
new lens to interpret data taken from existing long-term outage
measurements, thus requiring no additional traffic.  (If new
collection was required, it would be lightweight, since on average,
outage detection requires less than 20 probes per hour per /24 block;
less than 1\% of background radiation.)  Second, we show that spectral
analysis of this measure can identify \emph{diurnal usage}: blocks
where addresses are regularly used during part of the day and idle in
other times.  Finally, we analyze data for the entire responsive
Internet (3.7M /24 blocks) over 35 days.  These global observations
show \emph{when} and \emph{where} the Internet sleeps---networks are
mostly always-on in the US and Western Europe, and diurnal in much of
Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe.  ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
testing shows that diurnal networks correlate negatively with country
GDP and electrical consumption, quantifying that national policies and
economics relate to networks.

  Increasingly, network operators do not directly operate computers on
  their network, yet are responsible for assessing network
  vulnerabilities to ensure compliance with laws and policies about
  information disclosure, and tracking services that affect
  provisioning.  Thus, with decentralized network management,
  \emph{service discovery} becomes an important part of maintaining and
  protecting computer networks.  We explore two approaches to service
  discovery:  \emph{active probing} and \emph{passive monitoring}.
  Active probing finds all services currently on the network, except
  services temporarily unavailable or hidden by firewalls; however, it
  is often too invasive, especially if used across administrative
  boundaries.  Passive monitoring is typically much slower and can find
  transient services, but misses services that are idle.  We compare the
  accuracy of passive and active approaches to service discovery and
  show that they are complimentary, highlighting the need for multiple
  active scans coupled with long-duration passive monitoring.  We find
  passive monitoring is well suited for quickly finding popular
  services, finding servers responsible for 99\% of incoming connections
  within minutes.  Active scanning is better suited to rapidly finding
  \emph{all} servers, which is important for vulnerability
  detection--one scan finds 98\% of services in two hours, missing only
  a handful.  External scans are an unexpected ally to passive
  monitoring, speeding service discovery by the equivalent of 9--15 days
  of additional observation.  Finally, we show how the use of static or
  dynamic addresses changes the effectiveness of service discovery, both
  due to address reuse and VPN effects.

many applications in planning address allocation, topology studies,
and simulations.  Prior studies used active probing, sometimes
augmented with passive observation, to study \emph{macroscopic}
phenomena, such as the overall usage of the IPv4 address space.  This
paper instead studies the completeness of \emph{passive} sources:  how
well they can observe \emph{microscopic} phenomena such as address
usage within a given network.  We define \textit{sparsity} as the
limitation of a given monitor to see a target, and we quantify the
effects of interest, temporal, and coverage sparsity.  To study
sparsity, we introduce \emph{inverted analysis}, a novel approach that
uses complete passive observations of a few end networks (three campus
networks in our case) to infer what of these networks would be seen by
millions of \emph{virtual} monitors near their traffic's destinations.
Unsurprisingly, we find that monitors near popular content see many
more targets and that visibility is strongly influenced by bipartite
traffic between clients and servers.  We are the first to quantify
these effects and show their implications for the study of Internet
liveness from passive observations.  We find that visibility is
heavy-tailed, with only 0.5\% monitors seeing more than 10\% of our
targets' addresses, and is most affected by \emph{interest sparsity}
over temporal and coverage sparsity.  Visibility is also strongly
bipartite.  Monitors of a different class than a target (e.g., a
server monitor observing a client target) outperform monitors of the
same class as a target in 82-99\% of cases in our datasets.  Finally,
we find that adding active probing to passive observations greatly
improves visibility of both server and client target addresses, but is
not critical for visibility of target blocks.  Our findings are
valuable to understand limitations of existing measurement studies,
and to develop methods to maximize microscopic completeness in future
studies.",

Measurement Barriers to Internet Research (WOMBIR) with the goal of
understanding challenges in network and security data set collection
and sharing. Most workshop attendees provided white papers describing
their perspectives, and many participated in short-talks and
discussion in two virtual workshops over five days. That discussion
produced consensus around several points. First, many aspects of the
Internet are characterized by decreasing visibility of important
network properties, which is in tension with the Internet's role as
critical infrastructure. We discussed three specific research areas
that illustrate this tension: security, Internet access; and mobile
networking. We discussed visibility challenges at all layers of the
networking stack, and the challenge of gathering data and validating
inferences.  Important data sets require longitudinal (long-term,
ongoing) data collection and sharing, support for which is more
challenging for Internet research than other fields. We discussed why
a combination of technical and policy methods are necessary to
safeguard privacy when using or sharing measurement data. Workshop
participant proposed several opportunities to accelerate progress,
some of which require coordination across government, industry, and
academia."

Although the Internet is widely used today, we have little information
about the edge of the network.  Decentralized management, firewalls,
and sensitivity to probing prevent easy answers and make measurement
difficult.  Building on frequent ICMP probing of 1\% of the Internet
address space, we develop clustering and analysis methods to estimate
how Internet addresses are used.  We show that adjacent addresses
often have similar characteristics and are used for similar purposes
(61\% of addresses we probe are consistent blocks of 64 neighbors or
more).  We then apply this block-level clustering to provide data to
explore several open questions in how networks are managed.  First, we
provide information about how effectively network address blocks
appear to be used, finding that a significant number of blocks are
only lightly used (most addresses in about one-fifth of /24 blocks are
in use less than 10\% of the time), an important issue as the IPv4
address space nears full allocation.  Second, we provide new
measurements about dynamically managed address space, showing nearly
40\% of /24 blocks appear to be dynamically allocated, and dynamic
addressing is most widely used in countries more recent to the
Internet (more than 80\% in China, while less than 30\% in the U.S.).
Third, we distinguish blocks with low-bitrate last-hops and show that
such blocks are often underutilized.

shifted to work-from-home (WFH), and comprehensive maps have helped
visualize how those policies changed over time and in different

important to evaluate how effectively policies are implemented and
followed, or to confirm policies in countries with less transparent
journalism.  This paper describes a web-based visualization system for
measurements of Covid-19-induced WFH.  We build on a web-based world
map, showing a geographic grid of observations about WFH\@.  We extend
typical map interaction (zoom and pan, plus animation over time) with
two new forms of pop-up information that allow users to drill-down to
investigate our underlying data.  We use sparklines to show changes
over the first 6 months of 2020 for a given location, supporting
identification and navigation to hot spots.  Alternatively, users can
report particular networks (Internet Service Providers) that show WFH
on a given day.  We show that these tools help us relate our
observations to news reports of Covid-19-induced changes and, in some
cases, lockdowns due to other causes.  Our visualization is publicly
available at \url{https://covid.ant.isi.edu}, as is our underlying

One way is to work-from-home since lockdown has been announced in many regions around the world. For some places, however, we don't know if people really work from home due to the lack of information. Since there are lots of uncertainties, it would be helpful for us to understand what really happen in these places if we can detect the reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic. Working from home indicates that people have changed the way they interact with the Internet. People used to access the Internet in the company or at school during the day. Now it is more likely that they access the Internet at home in the daytime. Therefore, the network usage changes in one place can be used to indicate if people in this place actually work from home. In this work, we reuse and analyze Trinocular outages data (around 5.1M responsive /24 blocks) over 6 months to find network usage changes by a new designed algorithm. We apply the algorithm to sets of /24 blocks in several cities and compare the detected network usage changes with real world covid-19 events to verify if the algorithm can capture the changes reacting to the Covid-19 pandemic. By applying the algorithm to all measurable /24 blocks to detect network usages changes, we conclude that network usage can be an indicator of the reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic."

Since 2014 the ANT lab at USC has been observing the visible IPv4
Internet (currently 5 million networks measured every 11 minutes) to
detect network outages.  This talk explores how we use this
large-scale, active measurement to estimate Internet reliability and
understand the effects of real-world events such as hurricanes.  We
have recently developed new algorithms to identify Covid-19-related
Work-from-Home and other Internet shutdowns in this data.

	abstract = "Anycast-based services today are widely used commercially, with
several major providers serving thousands of important
websites. However, to our knowledge, there has been only limited study
of how often anycast fails because routing changes interrupt
connections between users and their current anycast site. While the
commercial success of anycast CDNs means anycast usually works well,
do some users end up shut out of anycast? In this paper we examine
data from more than 9000 geographically distributed vantage points
(VPs) to 11 anycast services to evaluate this question. Our
contribution is the analysis of this data to provide the first
quantification of this problem, and to explore where and why it
occurs. We see that about 1\% of VPs are \emph{anycast unstable},
reaching a different anycast site frequently (sometimes every
query). Flips back and forth between two sites in 10 seconds are
observed in selected experiments for given service and VPs. Moreover,
we show that anycast instability is \emph{persistent} for some VPs---a
few VPs never see a stable connections to certain anycast services
during a week or even longer. The vast majority of VPs only saw
unstable routing towards one or two services instead of instability
with all services, suggesting the cause of the instability lies
somewhere in the path to the anycast sites. We point out that for
highly-unstable VPs, their probability to hit a given site is
constant, suggesting load balancing might be the cause to anycast
routing flipping. Finally, we directly examine TCP flipping and show
that it is much rarer than UDP flipping, but does occur in about
0.15\% (VP, letter) combinations. Moreover, we show concrete cases in
which TCP connection timeout in anycast connection due to per-packet
flipping. Our findings confirm the common wisdom that anycast almost
always works well, but provide evidence that a small number of
locations in the Internet where specific anycast services are never
stable."

abstract = {The Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) approach has previously been shown to be effective in recruiting and retaining students, particularly under-represented students, in undergraduate introductory CS courses. In PLTL, small groups of students are led by an undergraduate peer and work together to solve problems related to CS. At Columbia University, the Columbia Emerging Scholars Program has used PLTL in an effort to increase enrollment in CS courses beyond the introductory level, and to increase the number of students who select Computer Science as their major, by demonstrating that CS is necessarily a collaborative activity that focuses more on problem solving and algorithmic thinking than on programming. Over the past six semesters, over 80 students have completed the program, and preliminary results indicate that this program has had a positive effect on increasing participation in the major.This paper discusses our experiences of building and expanding the Columbia Emerging Scholars program, and addresses such topics as recruiting, training, scheduling, student behavior, and evaluation. We expect that this paper will provide a valuable set of lessons learned to other educators who seek to launch or grow a PLTL program at their institution as well.},
